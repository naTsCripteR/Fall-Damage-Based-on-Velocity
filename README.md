# Fall-Damage-Based-on-Velocity
Roblox Fall damage based on Body Velocity

Well this is my first script for github

I made a fall damage based on BodyVelocity

# I recommend putting the damage event in a server script.
and use a good ragdoll module

# Warning
This script had a big bug, when you fall and didnÂ´t die the cam distorsion may got glitched
